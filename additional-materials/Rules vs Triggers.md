In PostgreSQL, **rules** and **triggers** are both mechanisms for customizing database behavior, especially around data modification (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`). However, they are quite different in design, purpose, and execution model.

### **1. Rules**

**Type:** Query rewriting
**Mechanism:** *Rewrite engine* (before query planning)
**Use Case:** Transparent view updates, query transformation, simple automation

#### Key Points:

* Rules are defined using `CREATE RULE`.
* A rule rewrites an incoming query into one or more new queries before execution.
* They are most often used with **views**, to allow `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` on views.
* Rules are **not procedural** — they don’t run a function or step-by-step logic.
* Multiple rules can fire and generate multiple queries from one original query.
* **Important:** Rules can be confusing and error-prone if you're not careful about the rewritten logic (e.g., infinite loops or duplicate operations).

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE RULE update_view AS
ON UPDATE TO my_view
DO INSTEAD (
    UPDATE my_table SET ... WHERE ...
);
```

### **2. Triggers**

**Type:** Event-driven function execution
**Mechanism:** *Trigger engine* (after query execution starts)
**Use Case:** Auditing, validation, cascading changes, enforcing business rules

#### Key Points:

* Triggers are defined using `CREATE TRIGGER`.
* A trigger executes a **user-defined function** (written in PL/pgSQL or another language) **before or after** an event (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.).
* Triggers are **procedural**, allowing for complex logic.
* You can access `NEW` and `OLD` row values inside the trigger function.
* Triggers can be **row-level** or **statement-level**.

#### Example:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER log_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON my_table
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_change();
```

### **Summary Comparison**

| Feature        | Rules                           | Triggers                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Execution Time | Before planning (query rewrite) | During execution                |
| Logic Type     | Declarative (rewriting)         | Procedural (function execution) |
| Granularity    | Statement-level only            | Row-level or statement-level    |
| Use With Views | Yes (commonly used)             | No (not directly)               |
| Access to Data | No access to `OLD`/`NEW` rows   | Full access to `OLD`/`NEW` rows |
| Complexity     | Harder to debug, brittle        | Easier to control, more robust  |

### When to Use Which?

* **Use a rule** if you're working with updatable views and want to transform an entire query.
* **Use a trigger** if you need to enforce business logic, log changes, or act on individual row changes.

In modern PostgreSQL development, **triggers** are far more commonly used than rules, due to their clarity and control. Rules are considered a legacy feature for most use cases except view updates.
